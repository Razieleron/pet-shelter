  Welcome to Maple Pet Sanctuary.  We're saviors, basically - but it's not about us!  It's about the pets.  Please adopt one of our pets and give them a good home. Below you will find links to our animals - and they're so adorable you could puke.  Like literally, Sandra had to stop volunteering here because of it.
